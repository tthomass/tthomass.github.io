We're used to hearing stories of male abusers, and for many years it's been our job as good citizens to look out for women.

She shows up to work with bruises and doesn't explain them.... They fight when he wants to leave and she doesn't.... She shrinks when someone raises thier voice.

We've been told many times about the warning signs, and the message that's been repeated is "women are weak. If somebody doesn't do something, it might be too late."


We hear stories in the news about horrific acts, and fear drives the message home.

We even talk about mothers and children in our comminities who have been affected by abuse, and for good reason: sometimes someone **does** need to step in.

Sometimes, someone being abused is restricted so much that they themselves can't act and all we have to go on are moments of insight.


But, we're missing something important when we assume that the agressor is male.


Think back for a moment to those warning signs.

When you pictured this woman, how strong was she?

Did you fill in her backstory? If so, what did you assume about thier relationship?

Did you consider that the bruises she won't explain were caused when she started a fight with her husband that escalated when she repeatedly punched him, and all he did to defend himself while being beaten was try to grab her wrist so he could escape and get out of the house?

Did you consider that the fight they had was because he was worn out after a long day,  but she couldn't allow him to go home alone due to being unjustly paranoid that he would meet someone on the way?

Did you consider that she shrinks because she grew up in an abusive household? That no matter how kind her husband is, no matter how many years he puts in to making himself a better husband, no matter how much of a solid foundation he tries to build for her, no matter how much he bleeds love; he just can't fix her..


###What does he do when the kids start being affected?
