    "In the best interests of the child" is an open site that looks forward to the future when there are no more stereotypes getting in the way of raising happy, well-adjusted, and deeply loved children.</br>
    It's based on the collected experiences of either people I know personally, or myself.</br>
    Mostly, we're Canadian. It's a mess up here.
