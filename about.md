My name is Thomas, and I'm a father who tried for over 15 years to work with an emotionally abusive spouse.
I've been the wall, the shield, the servant, the doormat, the friend, the doctor, the guide.

Some of us believe so strongly that we can fix our partner that we can lose sight of how much the kids are watching and learning. They aren't always learning how thier parents are... sometimes they are learning how to treat themselves when they get older.
